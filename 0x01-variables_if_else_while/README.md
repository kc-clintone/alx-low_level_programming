# 0x01-variables_if_else_while

Welcome to the `0x01-variables_if_else_while` directory! This collection of C source files focuses on mastering the fundamental concepts of variables, conditional statements (if-else), and loops (while) in programming. By exploring and working with these files, you'll gain a solid understanding of how to control the flow of your program and make decisions based on various conditions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have a basic understanding of C programming concepts, including data types, operators, and syntax.

## Files Overview

Here's an in-depth look at each file in this directory, along with its purpose and what you can learn from it:

### 0-positive_or_negative.c

This file introduces you to the concept of conditional statements. It generates a random number and then prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero. This serves as an excellent starting point for understanding the basic structure of an if-else statement.

### 1-last_digit.c

In this file, you'll explore how to extract the last digit of a number and make decisions based on that digit. The program generates a random number and determines whether the last digit is greater than 5, less than 6 but not 0, or 0.

### 2-print_alphabet.c

The `2-print_alphabet.c` program demonstrates how to print the lowercase alphabet using a loop. You'll gain experience with the `while` loop and character handling in C.

### 3-print_alphabets.c

This file builds on the previous one by printing both the lowercase and uppercase alphabets side by side. It showcases nested loops and provides an introduction to controlling loop behavior.

### 4-print_alphabt.c

In this program, you'll learn how to print the lowercase alphabet excluding specific letters. It helps you practice using conditional statements within loops to control output.

### 5-print_numbers.c

The `5-print_numbers.c` script focuses on printing single-digit numbers using a loop. It reinforces the concept of loops, helps you practice character-to-integer conversions, and emphasizes the importance of loop control variables.

### 6-print_numberz.c

Building on the previous file, `6-print_numberz.c` prints single-digit numbers again but without using a `char` data type. It demonstrates the ASCII representation of numbers and the importance of character manipulation.

### 7-print_tebahpla.c

The `7-print_tebahpla.c` program reverses the lowercase alphabet using a loop. This exercise emphasizes loop control variables and showcases how to print characters in reverse order.

### 8-print_base16.c

In this file, you'll explore printing hexadecimal numbers. The program uses two nested loops to print the numbers from 0 to 9 and the characters from 'a' to 'f', effectively displaying the hexadecimal numeral system.

### 9-print_comb.c

The `9-print_comb.c` script combines digits to create a list of unique two-digit combinations. It teaches you how to manage loop iterations, add conditions to prevent redundant combinations, and control the formatting of output.

### 100-print_comb3.c

Building on the previous file, `100-print_comb3.c` generates and prints all possible combinations of two different digits. This exercise challenges your ability to manage nested loops and control the inclusion of certain combinations.

### 101-print_comb4.c

This program takes the concept of unique combinations further by printing all possible combinations of three different digits. It encourages you to think about nested loops and how to control them for different outcomes.

### 102-print_comb5.c

The `102-print_comb5.c` script explores the concept of nested loops to generate and print all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers. It showcases advanced loop control and demonstrates how to manage nested loop variables.

## Tips

Each file's description above includes example commands to compile and run the program, as well as a brief explanation of its purpose. As you work through the files, consider experimenting with different inputs, modifying the code to explore alternative solutions, and observing the output to deepen your understanding.
