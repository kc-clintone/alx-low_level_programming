# 0x0E C - Structures, typedef Project

Welcome to the **0x0E C - Structures, typedef** project! This project aims to help you understand and apply the concepts of structures and typedef in the C programming language. By working with custom data types and enhancing code readability through typedef, you'll gain valuable insights into building more organized and maintainable programs.

## Project Overview

In this project, you'll delve into the world of structures, which enable you to create composite data types that group variables of different types under a single entity. Additionally, you'll learn how to use the `typedef` keyword to create aliases for existing data types, making your code more intuitive and less error-prone.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A basic understanding of the C programming language.
- A development environment with a C compiler (e.g., GCC) and a text editor or IDE.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone the project repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/kc-clintone/alx-low_level_programming/0x0E-structures-typedef) or download the ZIP archive.
2. Set up your development environment with a C compiler and a suitable text editor or IDE.
3. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal or file explorer.

## How to Use

### dog.h

The `dog.h` header file provides the structure definition, function prototypes, and a `typedef` alias for the `struct dog` type.

- To access the `struct dog` definition and the `dog_t` alias, include this header in your code using `#include "dog.h"`.

### 1-init_dog.c

The `1-init_dog.c` source file contains the `init_dog` function, which initializes a `struct dog` instance with specific values for its fields.

- To use the `init_dog` function, include the corresponding header and call the function with the necessary arguments.

### 2-print_dog.c

The `2-print_dog.c` source file provides the `print_dog` function, which prints the details of a `struct dog` instance, handling uninitialized or missing fields gracefully.

- To display dog information, include the `print_dog` function and call it with a `struct dog` instance.

### 4-new_dog.c

In the `4-new_dog.c` source file, you'll find the `new_dog` function, which dynamically creates a new `struct dog` instance and initializes its fields with provided values.

- To create new dog instances, include the `new_dog` function and follow its usage guidelines.

### 5-free_dog.c

The `5-free_dog.c` file contains the `free_dog` function, which releases the memory allocated for a `struct dog` instance.

- To manage memory efficiently, include the `free_dog` function when you're done using a dog instance.

## Examples

Here are some examples illustrating how to use the functions and structures in the project:

1. Using `init_dog` to initialize a `struct dog` instance:

```c
#include "dog.h"

int main(void) {
    dog_t my_dog;
    init_dog(&my_dog, "Buddy", 3.5, "Owner Name");
    // ...
    return 0;
}
```

2. Printing dog information using `print_dog`:

```c
#include "dog.h"

int main(void) {
    dog_t some_dog;
    // Assume some_dog is initialized
    print_dog(some_dog);
    // ...
    return 0;
}
```

3. Creating and managing a new dog using `new_dog` and `free_dog`:

```c
#include "dog.h"

int main(void) {
    dog_t *new_puppy = new_dog("Max", 1.5, "New Owner");
    // ...
    free_dog(new_puppy);
    // ...
    return 0;
}
```
