## Introduction

Welcome to the C Programming - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. By completing the tasks in this project, you will gain practical experience in using pointers, arrays, and manipulating strings.

## Resources

Before starting this project, it is recommended to read or watch the following topics:

- [C - Arrays](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_arrays.htm)
- [C - Pointers](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_strings.htm)
- [C - Strings](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_strings.htm)
- [Memory Layout](https://aticleworld.com/memory-layout-of-c-program/)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain the following topics to anyone, without the help of Google:

1. What are pointers and how to use them.
2. What are arrays and how to use them.
3. The differences between pointers and arrays.
4. How to use strings and how to manipulate them.
5. The scope of variables in C.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kc-clintone/alx-low_level_programming/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings
   ```
3. Start exploring the code and learning materials.

## Topics Covered

This repository covers the following topics:

- Introduction to pointers and their usage in C.
- Working with arrays effectively in C.
- Understanding the differences between pointers and arrays.
- String handling in C, including string manipulation.
- Exploring the scope of variables in C.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository contains the source code for various tasks related to pointers, arrays, and strings in C. Each task is located in its respective file inside this repository.

Here is an overview of what each file is doing:

| File                 | Description                                                                                                                                         |
