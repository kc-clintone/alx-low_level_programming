# 0x03-debugging

Welcome to the `0x03-debugging` directory! Debugging is a crucial skill for any programmer. In this collection of C source files, you'll explore common debugging techniques and strategies to identify and fix errors in your code. Through these files, you'll gain valuable insights into debugging processes and develop proficiency in troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have a solid understanding of C programming basics, including data types, loops, and conditional statements.

## Files Overview

Here's a look at each file in this directory, along with its purpose and the debugging concepts you can learn from it:

### 0-main.c

In the `0-main.c` file, you'll encounter an example of a simple C program with a logical error. This exercise is designed to teach you how to identify logical errors through careful code inspection.

### 1-main.c

The `1-main.c` script also features a C program with an issue. Your task is to identify and fix the logical error using your debugging skills. This exercise emphasizes the importance of examining code closely and thinking critically.

### 2-largest_number.c

In this file, you'll find a C function that aims to determine the largest of three numbers. However, there's a logical error that causes incorrect results in certain scenarios. Your goal is to debug the code to ensure it correctly identifies the largest number.

### 3-convert_day.c

The `3-convert_day.c` script is part of a program that converts a date into the day of the year. Your task is to identify and fix an error in the `convert_day` function that prevents accurate date conversion.

### 3-print_remaining_days.c

Building on the previous file, `3-print_remaining_days.c` is designed to print the remaining days of the year for a given date. Similar to the previous file, you'll need to identify and fix a bug that impacts the accuracy of the result.

### positive_or_negative.c

The `positive_or_negative.c` file revisits the concept of the `positive_or_negative` function from a previous directory. Your task is to identify and fix a bug in the function's logic.

### main.h

The `main.h` header file contains function prototypes and includes for various functions used in the files within this directory. It ensures that the functions are correctly declared and accessible across different files.

## Tips

Each file's description above includes its purpose and the debugging concepts it covers. While some of the files don't have example commands to compile and run, you can observe the code, analyze the logic, and identify errors based on the context provided.
