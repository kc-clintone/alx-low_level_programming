# 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops

Welcome to the `0x04-more_functions_nested_loops` directory! In this collection of C source files, you'll delve deeper into functions and nested loops. You'll explore a variety of tasks that will enhance your understanding of these concepts, helping you build more complex programs with greater precision and versatility.

## Prerequisites

Before you start working with these files, make sure you have a solid understanding of C programming fundamentals, including functions, loops, and control structures.

## Files Overview

Here's an overview of each file in this directory, along with its purpose and the concepts you can learn from it:

### 0-isupper.c

The `0-isupper.c` file contains a custom implementation of the `isupper` function. Your task is to define the `int _isupper(int c)` function that checks if a character is uppercase. This exercise reinforces your ability to create custom functions that perform specific tasks.

### 1-isdigit.c

In this file, you'll implement the `int _isdigit(int c)` function, which checks if a character is a digit (0-9). This exercise builds on the previous file and demonstrates your ability to write custom functions that return values based on specific conditions.

### 2-mul.c

The `2-mul.c` script defines the `int mul(int a, int b)` function, which calculates the product of two integers. This exercise enhances your function-writing skills for mathematical operations.

### 3-print_numbers.c

In this file, you'll find the `void print_numbers(void)` function, which prints the numbers from 0 to 9. This script emphasizes loop control and function usage.

### 4-print_most_numbers.c

The `4-print_most_numbers.c` program defines the `void print_most_numbers(void)` function, which prints the numbers from 0 to 9 except for 2 and 4. It showcases how to exclude specific numbers from printing using loop control and conditional statements.

### 5-more_numbers.c

This script introduces the `void more_numbers(void)` function, which prints the numbers from 0 to 14 multiple times. The exercise helps you practice nested loops and formatting output.

### 6-print_line.c

The `6-print_line.c` file contains the `void print_line(int n)` function, which prints a straight line of length `n` using the character `_`. This exercise emphasizes loop control and repetitive character printing.

### 7-print_diagonal.c

In this file, you'll implement the `void print_diagonal(int n)` function, which prints a diagonal line of length `n` using the `\` character. This script showcases nested loops and conditionals for controlling character placement.

### 8-print_square.c

The `8-print_square.c` program defines the `void print_square(int size)` function, which prints a square of side length `size` using the `#` character. You'll practice nested loops and conditional statements.

### 9-fizz_buzz.c

In this file, you'll create the `void fizz_buzz(void)` function, which prints the numbers from 1 to 100 with certain conditions. The exercise encourages you to apply conditional statements to specific numbers and their multiples.

### 10-print_triangle.c

The `10-print_triangle.c` script introduces the `void print_triangle(int size)` function, which prints a right-angled triangle of height `size` using the `#` character. This exercise further enhances your ability to control nested loops for pattern printing.

### 100-prime_factor.c

This program calculates and prints the largest prime factor of a given number. It challenges your understanding of prime factorization and mathematical operations.

### 101-print_number.c

The `101-print_number.c` file contains the `void print_number(int n)` function, which prints an integer `n` using only `_putchar` and without using standard library functions like `printf`. This exercise provides insights into character-to-digit conversion and output formatting.
