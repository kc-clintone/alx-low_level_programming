# 0x02-functions_nested_loops

Welcome to the `0x02-functions_nested_loops` directory! This collection of C source files dives deeper into the world of C programming by introducing functions, nested loops, and control structures. Through these files, you'll gain a thorough understanding of how to create and use functions, implement nested loops, and solve a variety of problems.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have a solid grasp of C programming basics, including data types, operators, conditional statements, and loops.

## Files Overview

Here's a brief look at each file in this directory, along with its purpose and the concepts you can learn from it:

### 0-putchar.c

The `0-putchar.c` file demonstrates the basic usage of the `_putchar` function, which prints a single character to the standard output. This function is a fundamental building block for creating more complex programs that involve printing characters.

### 1-alphabet.c

In this file, you'll create a function `print_alphabet` that prints the lowercase alphabet using a loop. This exercise reinforces your understanding of loops and introduces the concept of defining and using functions.

### 2-print_alphabet_x10.c

The `2-print_alphabet_x10.c` program builds on the previous file by printing the lowercase alphabet ten times. This file emphasizes function calls within loops and demonstrates how to structure your code for reusability.

### 3-islower.c

In the `3-islower.c` script, you'll implement the `islower` function, which checks if a character is lowercase. This exercise helps you practice creating custom functions that return values based on conditions.

### 4-isalpha.c

Building on the previous concept, the `4-isalpha.c` program defines the `isalpha` function, which checks if a character is an alphabetic character (either uppercase or lowercase). This file further enhances your function-writing skills.

### 5-sign.c

The `5-sign.c` script implements the `print_sign` function, which prints the sign of a number (positive, negative, or zero) using nested if-else statements. This exercise introduces nested control structures.

### 6-abs.c

This program defines the `int _abs(int n)` function, which calculates the absolute value of an integer. It reinforces your ability to write functions and work with mathematical operations.

### 7-print_last_digit.c

In this file, you'll create the `print_last_digit` function, which prints the last digit of a number. You'll also practice using the `abs` function introduced earlier.

### 8-24_hours.c

The `8-24_hours.c` program prints every minute of a 24-hour day using nested loops. This exercise emphasizes nested loop control and demonstrates a practical application of nested loops.

### 9-times_table.c

This program generates and prints the times table of a given number. It showcases the use of nested loops for generating and formatting tabular data.

### 10-add.c

The `10-add.c` script defines the `add` function, which computes the sum of two integers. This exercise hones your function-writing skills for mathematical operations.

### 11-print_to_98.c

In this file, you'll create the `print_to_98` function, which prints all natural numbers from a given number up to 98. This program demonstrates the control of loop behavior based on specific conditions.

### 100-times_table.c

Building on the previous times table concept, the `100-times_table.c` script generates and prints a times table with variable size and formatting.

### 101-natural.c

The `101-natural.c` program computes and prints the sum of all natural numbers that are multiples of 3 or 5 up to a given limit. This exercise emphasizes loop control, conditions, and mathematical calculations.

### 102-fibonacci.c

This file defines the `fibonacci` function, which calculates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number of terms. The exercise practices function implementation and recursion.

### 103-fibonacci.c

Building on the previous Fibonacci sequence, the `103-fibonacci.c` script calculates the sum of even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified limit. This file combines concepts of loops, conditionals, and mathematical calculations.

### 104-fibonacci.c

The `104-fibonacci.c` program calculates and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers. It challenges your understanding of large calculations, printing, and control structures.

### _putchar.c

The `_putchar.c` file provides the definition for the `_putchar` function used in previous files. This ensures that the function is available for use across multiple programs.

## Tips

Each file's description above includes example commands to compile and run the program, as well as a brief explanation of its purpose. As you work through the files, consider experimenting with different inputs, modifying the code to explore alternative solutions, and observing the output to deepen your understanding.
