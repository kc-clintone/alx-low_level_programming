# 0x0F-Function_Pointers

Welcome to the **0x0F-Function_Pointers** project! This project is designed to help you understand and apply the concept of function pointers in the C programming language. By working with function pointers, you'll gain insight into creating more flexible and dynamic programs.

## Project Overview

In this project, you'll dive into the world of function pointers, a powerful feature that allows you to store and use references to functions in your programs. By using function pointers, you can write more modular and versatile code that can adapt to different situations.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A basic understanding of the C programming language.
- A development environment with a C compiler (e.g., GCC) and a text editor or IDE.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone the project repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/kc-clintone/alx-low_level_programming/0x0F-function_pointers) or download the ZIP archive.
2. Set up your development environment with a C compiler and a suitable text editor or IDE.
3. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal or file explorer.

## How to Use

### function_pointers.h

The `function_pointers.h` header file provides function prototypes and typedefs related to function pointers.

- Include this header in your source files to access the necessary function prototypes and typedefs.

### 0-print_name.c

The `0-print_name.c` source file contains a function that prints a given name using a function pointer.

- To use this function, include the corresponding header and call the function with a name and the function pointer to the printing function.

### 1-array_iterator.c

In the `1-array_iterator.c` source file, you'll find a function that applies a given function to each element of an array.

- Include the corresponding header and call the function with an array, its size, and the function pointer to be applied.

### 100-main_opcodes.c

The `100-main_opcodes.c` source file is a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.

- Compile this file and run the resulting executable to observe the opcodes of the main function.

### 2-int_index.c

The `2-int_index.c` source file contains a function that searches for an integer in an array using a function pointer.

- Include the corresponding header and call the function with an array, its size, the integer to search for, and the function pointer for comparison.

### 3-main.c, 3-calc.h, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-op_functions.c

These files are part of a simple calculator program using function pointers. The calculator performs arithmetic operations based on user input.

- Compile and run the program to use the calculator. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations.

## Examples

Examples illustrating how to use the functions and concepts in the project:

1. Using a function pointer to print a name:

```c
#include "function_pointers.h"

void print_upper(char *str) {
    // Implementation to print the name in uppercase
}

int main(void) {
    char name[] = "Alice";
    void (*printer)(char *);
    printer = print_upper;
    print_name(name, printer);
    // ...
    return 0;
}
```

2. Applying a function to each element of an array:

```c
#include "function_pointers.h"

void print_squared(int num) {
    printf("%d\n", num * num);
}

int main(void) {
    int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    array_iterator(array, 5, print_squared);
    // ...
    return 0;
}
```

3. Using a function pointer to search for an integer:

```c
#include "function_pointers.h"

int is_even(int num) {
    return num % 2 == 0;
}

int main(void) {
    int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int index = int_index(array, 5, is_even);
    // ...
    return 0;
}
```
