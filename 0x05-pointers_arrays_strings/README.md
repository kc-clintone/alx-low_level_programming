## Introduction

Welcome to the C Programming - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. By completing the tasks in this project, you will gain practical experience in using pointers, arrays, and manipulating strings.

## Resources

Before starting this project, it is recommended to read or watch the following topics:

- [C - Arrays](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_arrays.htm)
- [C - Pointers](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_strings.htm)
- [C - Strings](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_strings.htm)
- [Memory Layout](https://aticleworld.com/memory-layout-of-c-program/)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain the following topics to anyone, without the help of Google:

1. What are pointers and how to use them.
2. What are arrays and how to use them.
3. The differences between pointers and arrays.
4. How to use strings and how to manipulate them.
5. The scope of variables in C.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kc-clintone/alx-low_level_programming/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings
   ```
3. Start exploring the code and learning materials.

## Topics Covered

This repository covers the following topics:

- Introduction to pointers and their usage in C.
- Working with arrays effectively in C.
- Understanding the differences between pointers and arrays.
- String handling in C, including string manipulation.
- Exploring the scope of variables in C.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository contains the source code for various tasks related to pointers, arrays, and strings in C. Each task is located in its respective file inside this repository.

Here is an overview on what each file is doing:

| File            | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-reset_to_98.c | This file contains a function that takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`                                |
| 1-swap.c        | This file contains a function that swaps the values of two integers                                                                                   |
| 2-strlen.c      | This file contains a function that returns the length of a string                                                                                     |
| 3-puts.c        | This file contains a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`                                                               |
| 4-print_rev.c   | This file contains a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line                                                                |
| 5-rev_string.c  | This file contains a function that reverses a string.                                                                                                 |
| 6-puts2.c       | This file contains a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.               |
| 7-puts_half.c   | This file contains a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.                                                                   |
| 8-print_array.c | This file contains a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line                                                  |
