# 0x09-static_libraries

Welcome to the "Static Libraries" directory! This directory contains essential files related to static libraries in C programming. Static libraries are collections of precompiled functions that can be linked to your program during the compilation process, providing a modular and efficient way to manage code reuse. Let's dive into the details of the files you'll find in this directory:

## File Descriptions

Here's a brief explanation of each file in the "Static Libraries" directory:

### libmy.a

`libmy.a` is a static library file. A static library is a collection of object files that are combined together into a single file. These object files can contain compiled functions and code that you can reuse in your programs. The `libmy.a` static library in this directory likely contains various functions that can be linked into your C programs.

To use the functions from this library in your program, you need to include the library during the compilation process. This can be achieved using the `-l` flag followed by the library name (without the `lib` prefix) when compiling your program. For example:

```bash
gcc -o my_program my_program.c -lmy
```

This command tells the compiler to link the `libmy.a` library to your program.

### create_static_lib.sh

`create_static_lib.sh` is a shell script that simplifies the process of creating a static library. This script compiles a set of source files into object files and then creates a static library from those object files. The resulting static library can be used in other programs to access the functions defined in the source files.

The script likely performs the following steps:

1. Compiles the source files (e.g., `*.c` files) into object files (e.g., `*.o` files).
2. Creates a static library by combining the object files.

You can run the script using the following command:

```bash
./create_static_lib.sh
```

Make sure the script is executable (`chmod +x create_static_lib.sh`) before running it.

## Usage

Here's how you can use the files in this directory:

1. **Using `libmy.a`**: To use functions from the `libmy.a` library in your C programs, include the library during compilation using the `-l` flag followed by the library name (without the `lib` prefix).

2. **Running the Script**: If you want to create your own static library, you can use the `create_static_lib.sh` script. Make sure to place your source files in the same directory as the script, and execute it to generate the static library.

## Examples

Suppose you have a file `my_program.c` that uses functions from the `libmy.a` library. You can compile and link your program like this:

```bash
gcc -o my_program my_program.c -lmy
```

This command tells the compiler to link the functions from `libmy.a` to your program.

If you have your own source files, you can use the `create_static_lib.sh` script to create your own static library:

```bash
./create_static_lib.sh
```

## Tips

- Static libraries are a way to package and reuse code efficiently in C programming.
- Make sure your source files are compiled into object files before creating the static library.
- Use the appropriate naming conventions for the library and object files (e.g., `libmy.a` and `my_function.o`).
